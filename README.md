# Leetshowcase
I have created a landing page where a user can enter his/her Leetcode username and press the getinfo button,and the Leetcode stats of the username will be shown to the user.I have used HTML,CSS and JS to build this project.I have used the public end point API of Leetcode available on GitHub.This project has helped in strengthening my understanding about Fetch api in Javascript,DOM manipulation using JS.It has also made my understanding about promises in JS better.Further I have style the landing page using CSS.
Overall this project has helped me in making me good at HTML,CSS and JS.

If you do not have Leetcode username here are few usernames you can use for trying out the project:

1. vishalkurve  (My username)
2. rahulvarma5297
3. numb3r5
4. Mazhar_MIK 
5. LoveBabbar
6. votrubac
7. penguinhacker
